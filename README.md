#A bit of fun with a ```React-Native``` Tutorial

- Building out an iOS app with ```React-Native```
- Started to mess with an npm module to make my backend and then got annoyed,
took a little break from ```RN```  to wire up a basic node api

**This app is in progress, and not refactored. Just represents what I'm learning
about as I revist an old resource**

Feel free to give me a holler if you have suggestions at forrest@kd2mzh.com
