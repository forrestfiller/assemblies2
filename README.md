A Meetup-like iOS App with React-Native
======

### Current Features

- A splash page with buttons routing the user to authentication options

- A tabbed UI with:
  - Activities
  - Messages
  - Profile

- API in ```Node.js``` with a GUI that generates routes for me using the ```npm module``` **```deployd```** [note: normally I use backend's I've written myself, however for the sake of spending more time with the ```React-Native``` code, I'm eschewing my traditional approach for now.  Once the project is built out with functional features, I plan to write up the ```Node.js``` backend to replace **```deployd```**]

- I'm in the process of rendering various components including a basic mapView that includes some placeholder content.
- Authentication is in-progress, Login is almost setup. Haven't set up Registration yet.

I've been following along with a ```React-Native``` tutorial I bought last year, however I have been finding myself deviating from their boilerplate in some places.

After I get the app up on iOS, I'm looking forward to building out the Android side to explore that experience, as I have some iOS Swift experience but haven't messed around too much with development for Android. Also, having a SPA on the web with ```React.js``` and ```Node.js``` will be a fun 'tripple-crown' for this project.

Stay tuned.
